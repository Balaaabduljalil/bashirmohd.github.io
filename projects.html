                          <p>As the numbers of internet users and connected devices continue to multiply, due to big data and Cloud applications, network traffic is growing at an exponential rate. WAN networks, in particular, are witnessing very large traffic spikes cause by large file transfers that last from a few minutes to hours on network links and there is a need to develop innovative ways in which flows can be managed in real-time.</p>
                          <p>In this work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach, in particular Upper-Confidence Algorithm, to learn optimal paths and reroute traffic to improve network utilization. We present throughput and flow diversions using Mininet and demo the technique using Chameleon's Testbed (Bring-Your-Own-Controller [BYOC] functionality). This work is initial implementation towards DeepRoute, which combines Deep reinforcement learning algorithms with SDN controllers to create and route traffic using deployed OpenFlow switches.</p>

                            <p>In this study, we proposed
                            an innovative unsupervised clustering approach, DynamicDeepFlow, for network traffic pattern clustering. The DynamicDeepFlow can recognize unseen network traffic patterns based on the analysis of the rapid flow changes from the historical data. The proposed method consists of a deep learning model, variational autoencoder, and a shallow learning model, k-means++. The variational autoencoder is used to compress and extract the most useful features from the flow inputs. The compressed and extracted features then serve as input-output pairs to k-means++. The k-means++ explores the structure hidden in these features and then uses them to cluster the network traffic patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to apply a real-time network clustering approach to monitor network operations. The real-world network flow data from Energy Sciences Network (a network serving the U.S. Department of Energy to support U.S. scientific research) was utilized to verify the performance of the proposed approach in network traffic pattern clustering. The verification results show that the proposed method
                            is able to distinguish anomalous network traffic patterns from normal
                            patterns, and thereby trigger an anomaly flag.

                          <p>  Wide area networking infrastructures (WANs), particularly science and research WANs, are the backbone for moving large volumes of scientific data between experimental facilities and data centers. With demands growing at exponential rates, these networks are struggling to cope with large data volumes, real-time responses, and overall network performance. Network operators are increasingly looking for innovative ways to manage the limited underlying network resources. Forecasting network traffic is a critical capability for proactive resource management, congestion mitigation, and dedicated transfer provisioning. To this end, we propose a non autoregressive graph-based neural network for multistep network traffic forecasting. Specifically, we develop a dynamic variant of diffusion convolutional recurrent neural networks to forecast traffic in research WANs. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on real traffic from ESnet, the U.S. Department of Energy's dedicated science network. Our results show that compared to classical forecasting methods,  
                          our approach explicitly learns the dynamic nature of spatiotemporal traffic patterns, showing significant improvements in forecasting accuracy. Our technique can surpass existing statistical and deep learning approaches by achieving ~20% mean absolute percentage error for multiple hours of forecasts despite dynamic network traffic settings.

                          <p>Network monitoring services are of enormous importance to ensure optimal performance is being delivered and help determine any failing services. Particularly for large data transfers, checking key performance indicators like throughput, packet loss, and latency can make or break experiment results. However, network monitoring tools are very diverse in metrics collected and dependent on the devices installed. Additionally, there are limited tools that can learn and determine the cause of degraded performance. This paper presents NetGraf, a novel end-to-end learning monitoring system that utilizes current monitoring tools, merges multiple data sources into one dashboard for easy use, and provides machine learning libraries to analyze the data and perform real-time anomaly finding. Using a database backend, NetGraf can learn performance trends and show users if network performance has degraded. We demonstrate how NetGraf can easily be deployed through automation services and linked to multiple monitoring sources to collect data. Via the machine learning innovation and merging various data sources, NetGraf aims to fulfill the need for holistic learning network telemetry monitoring. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever end-to-end learning monitoring service. We demonstrate its use on two network setups to showcase its impact.</p>

                          <p>During bulk data transfer for exascale scientific applications, measuring the available throughput is very useful for route selection in high-speed networks, Quality of service verification, and traffic engineering. Recent years have seen a surge in available throughput estimation tools, especially in Research and Education (R\&E) Networks. Some tools have been proposed and evaluated in simulation and over a limited number of Internet paths. However, there is still significant uncertainty in the performance and flexibility of these tools at large. Furthermore, some existing tools' primary concern is the lack of network performance history or a memory that stores previous configurations and network measurements..</p>
                          <br>
                          <p>This work introduces Net-PreFlight, a simple end-to-end, lightweight tool for measuring available throughput, traceroute, and maintains memory, compared to existing tools like Iperf. Our tool focuses on throughput measurements, flexibility, a retentive memory, security, and performance. We conduct experiments between multiple Data Transfer Node (DTN) setups in isolated and public network setups to measure how throughput measurements fare in the two domains. In all scenarios, Net-Preflight produces comparable results as established tools and hence positions itself as a complementary tool for situations where the deployment of Iperf or perfSONAR is not possible. In addition, Net-Preflight features retentive memory to easily compare past and present measurements. Our analysis reveals that using socket and file transfer protocols performs well in initial measurements and also indicates that parallel TCP streams are equivalent to using a large maximum segment size on a single connection in the absence of congestion. Here, we lay the foundation to build a new monitoring system for DTN bulk transfers that target end-users who require optimum network performance.</p>

                            Wide area networks are built to have enough resilience and flexibility, such as offering many paths between multiple pairs of end hosts. To prevent congestion, current practices involve numerous tweaking of routing tables to optimize path computation, such as flow diversion to alternate paths or load balancing. However, this process is slow, costly and require difficult online decision-making to learn appropriate settings, such as flow arrival rate, workload, and current network environment. Inspired by recent advances in AI to manage resources, we present DeepRoute, a model-less reinforcement learning approach that translates the path computation problem to a learning problem. Learning from the network environment, DeepRoute learns strategies to manage arriving elephant and mice flows to improve the average path utilization in the network. Comparing to other strategies such as prioritizing certain flows and random decisions, DeepRoute is shown to improve average network path utilization to 30% and potentially reduce possible congestion across the whole network. 
                            <br>
                            This work presents results in simulation and also how DeepRoute can be demonstrated by a Mininet implementation.
